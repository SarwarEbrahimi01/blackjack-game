# blackjack-game
The Blackjack CLI Capstone Project is a Python-based command-line game where a user plays against an automated dealer to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without busting (exceeding 21). It focuses on implementing game logic, such as shuffling, dealing, calculating scores, handling Aces (1 or 11), and managing "Hit" or "Stand" decisions.
